# Train_Scheduler-Firebase

This project was an introduction to using Firebase as a means to create persistent data that is regenerated on page load no matter if browser if refreshed or closed and re opened. The app allows a user to enter in several inputs which are dynamically generated through the jQuery library. The app also utilized the moment.js library to calculate two of the data points based upon the users inputs.

## Getting Started

To get started, opend up the index.html file in your browswer. You will then be able to input values into the form fields. These values are then diplayed to the table along with the values that are calculated based upon the users inputs, notably when the next train arrives and how many minutes away the train currently is.

The user will not be able to clear the data from the table upon refresh or reopening the page. The data is persistent.
